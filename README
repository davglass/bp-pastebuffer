This only works on OSX ;)

First install BrowserPlus:
http://browserplus.yahoo.com/install/

Then Download the SDK:
http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/service/sdk/

Unzip it.

From this directory:

cd src/service
[path to sdk]/bin/ServiceInstaller -v .

Example:

../../../bpsdk/bin/ServiceInstaller -v .

That will install the Service on your machine..
